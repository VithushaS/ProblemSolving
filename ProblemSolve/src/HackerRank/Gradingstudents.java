 * Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  0 to 100.
Any grade  less than 40 is a failing grade. Sam is a professor at the university and likes
 to round each student's  grade according to these rules:
  If the difference between the  grade and the next multiple of  is 5 less than 3 ,
  round grade up to the next multiple of 5. If the value of  grade is less than 38 ,
   no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
